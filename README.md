## Problem Statement
Inspired by rainymood.com, rain clock is a webapp that calms you down after a strenuous day of work.
Imagine yourself crouching in a glass box -- floating in the middle of the sky -- as showers obliviate you from society.
You are finally free from the rustling of rubber boots against the floor and the words that people speak,
and you are finally given time to think about 

``` "What life really means to you?". ```

This app aims to give you the peace of mind to reflect on yourself -- the work you've done, the sacrifices that you have made, the fears
you have or haven't conquered, and the beauty that you appreciate. 

## Current Features

For more specific implementation of features, refer to code in this repository. 
- A screen full of raindrops that begin falling from the top of the screen. 
- A clock that represents that current time, allowing you to keep track of when you want to stop reflecting. 
- Anime voice that remind you of the time, in case you reflect with your eyes closed (ex. Meditate). 


## Possible Features to Implement in the Future 
- Instructions on how to use the app to reflect. 
- Customizable anime character voices. 
- Customizable rain speed.
