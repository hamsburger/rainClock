## Problem Statement
Inspired by rainymood.com, rain clock is a webapp that calms you down after a strenuous day of work.
Imagine yourself crouching in a glass box -- floating in the middle of the sky -- as showers obliviate you from society.
You are finally free from the rustling of rubber boots against the floor and the words that people speak,
and you are finally given time to think about 

``` "What life really means to you?". ```

This app aims to give you the peace of mind to reflect on yourself -- the work you've done, the sacrifices that you have made, the fears
you have or haven't conquered, and the beauty that you appreciate. 

## Current Features
- A screen full of raindrops that begin falling from the top of the screen.
    - On screen resize, the raindrop positions will be updated to fit the new resized screen.

- A clock that represents that current time, allowing you to keep track of your reflection time. 
- Anime voice that remind you of the time, in case you reflect with your eyes closed (ex. Meditate). 
    - [Kanna squeals every minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNIRzcLSwk) 
    - [Maid-sama screams at Usui at every hour](https://youtu.be/kEmE3QwSf3s?t=23)

- Adjust volume of all sounds on the web app, just in case if you don't want any interruptions at the moment.
- Instructions on how to use the app. (control volume, listen to the rain and clock)

## Features to Implement in the Future 
- Slider CSS needs to be improved. 'Volume Control' text positioning and slider SHOULD match up. 

- Customizable anime character voices. 
- Customizable rain speed. 


## Questions for Self
- Why is linespacing so difficult in JavaScript...
